       <strong> In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system.</strong>
       <br>
        Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate.

        <strong>Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate.</strong> <br>
        The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels. <br>
        Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane. <br>
        Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. <br>
        Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in the Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming.<br>
